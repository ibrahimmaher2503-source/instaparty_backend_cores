## REQUIRED CONTEXT (load before executing this command)

Before generating any artifact, you MUST silently read these files in order:
1. .specify/memory/constitution.md
2. .specify/memory/project-index.md
3. .specify/memory/api-registry.md
4. docs/specs/01_PRD.md
5. docs/specs/09_Phasing_Plan.md
6. docs/specs/11_DB_Schema.md
7. docs/specs/10_Package_List.md

CONSTRAINTS (non-negotiable):
- Every generated artifact must cite specific FR numbers from 01_PRD.md
- Every generated artifact must cite specific table names from 11_DB_Schema.md
- Every generated artifact must align to a Phase ID from 09_Phasing_Plan.md
- Never suggest a package not in 10_Package_List.md
- Never suggest a Phase 2 feature
- Never contradict docs/specs/02_Tech_Decisions.md locked stack

API DOCUMENTATION CONSTRAINT:
- Every API endpoint generated must include:
  - @bodyParam PHPDoc on every Form Request field (Scribe-compatible)
  - @response PHPDoc with realistic EN+AR example data on every Resource
  - Entry added to .specify/memory/api-registry.md
  - Bruno/Postman collection entry in docs/api/collections/

# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. CLI Interface -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Integration Testing -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Observability, VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes, VII. Simplicity -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required; Or: MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Or: Start simple, YAGNI principles -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->

**Version**: [CONSTITUTION_VERSION] | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]
<!-- Example: Version: 2.1.1 | Ratified: 2025-06-13 | Last Amended: 2025-07-16 -->
